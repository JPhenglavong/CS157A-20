Functional Requirements  - Khoa Pham & Yuxiao Zheng
Our users will be all of the movie-goers. They can register for an account that includes all 
the films they'd love to watch when release dates arrive along with a reminder timetable. Registering for an account is necessary
for the users to keep track of their timetable. After logging in to the account, they can see a list of upcoming movies, and they
can decide if they want to be reminded when the movie comes. In addition, clients can drop ratings to the film so that other clients 
can see and do so. Another feature is to also include a quick questionnaire on whether the user has seen the movie, does not want to be 
reminded anymore or to extend the reminder.
